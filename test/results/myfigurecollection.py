    "body"     : """\
Light up features on figures are pretty cool. Something to really look forward to after Preordering a figure...what will it look like?...It's gonna look so cool!...I can't wait!<br />
<br />
But that anticipation can be shattered if after receiving it you plug it in and it doesn't light up. That super sucks. I know. I've been through it.<br />
<br />
The good news is, <span class="i">there is hope!</span> if you're someone suffering in silence with a &quot;broken&quot; LED feature that won't light, there is a good chance it is NOT actually broken and you'll be able to get it to work after all. Read on to find out how.  <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:23px;line-height:37px"><span class="b">My Experience</span></span><br />
I ordered this <a href="https://myfigurecollection.net/item/2056949" title="https://myfigurecollection.net/item/2056949" class="internal-link">Tohru nightlight</a> from the Crunchroll store. As soon as I took it out of the box, I plugged it in using a USB-C power brick and cable (not included) to see what it looked like lit up. To my dismay it did not light up. So, I tried my laptop as the power source instead of the brick. Nothing. I decided to try one more thing. I have a power bank that can charge/power items via USB-C cable. Sadly nothing. Damn... I couldn't bear to live with it not working so I had to go through the hassle of contacting Crunchyroll and requesting a replacement. The process was actually easier than I expected (I didn't even have to send the first one back). A couple weeks later I received the second one. Plugged it in. Nothing. Tried my laptop. Nothing. Like...<span class="i">WAIT-a-minute</span>--WTF? What are the odds of two different figures sent at vastly different times both being defective?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:23px;line-height:37px"><span class="b">The Fix!</span></span><br />
So, I decided to try more power supply/cable combinations. Even though the nightlight connector was USB-C, I know how complex that protocol is, so I suspected <span class="i">maybe</span> it was something related to that? So, I went in search of the oldest cheapest standard (USB-A) brick I could find and used a USB-C to USB-A cable to make the connection. <span class="i">IT LIT RIGHT UP!</span> I snatched the first one I'd received off the shelf, unpacked it, and plugged it in to the el-cheapo setup. Same result. Lit right up. There was nothing wrong with it at all. <br />
<br />
So, what exactly is the problem? It's hard to say with 100% certainty, but all the power sources that I used were the fast-charging IQ/PD protocol type -- even the Power bank I tried as a source.  It appears the night light may not be compatible with these types of USB-C sources. Why? Well, new fast chargers handshake between the charging device and charged device to determine the best rate at which to charge. I think the figure accessory electronics are so basic that the power sources I had used couldn't even sense there was something attached, or didn't know what rate to output the power at, so they just didn't output anything. <span class="i">I know what you're thinking.</span> &quot;Fast-charging IQ/PD chargers are like the standard right now--I'm not sure I even have a plain old dumb power source around.&quot; Yup, that is a problem, and one that makes it very hard to understand why they'd produce products not compatible with the current standard in power sources.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:23px;line-height:37px"><span class="b">Figures Impacted (Know so Far)</span></span><br />
The following figures have LED features that are <span class="i">known</span> to be affected by what I described above. But I suspect there are more that have this same issue. <span class="i">If you know of others, please share in the comment section.</span><br />
